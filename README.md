# ext-weekend-movie-project

In this project, I am creating a movie database. 
Functionality includes adding movies by:
- name, genre, image url, release date and run time
- remove movies
- delete existing movies
- ability to show total number of movies next to each genre

There will be two views:
1. Enables user to add a movie
2. Allows for managing genres
